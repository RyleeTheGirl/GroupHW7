# GroupHW7

Describe any problems your group had writing the code


Did you change the classes that were tested?  Why or why not?
Yes, we did change the classes that were tested. We had to change the names of the methods because each animal had a different unique method name for each. We changed this so that the children classes matched and overrode the parent class methods. We also changed the Unit Test class so that it ran thorugh one if statement to test any animal instead of walking through each individual animal.


Describe your team's solution.  Explain how it meets the criteria given.


Do you think unit testing is important? Why or why not?

  -The ability or method to notify the observer if there has been any change.
  -The ability to listen or "observe" an object and recieve updates to be able to notify of changes.
